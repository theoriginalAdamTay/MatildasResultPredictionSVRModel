# Matildas Result Prediction SVR Model
The Matildas Result Prediction SVR Model is a machine learning regression model built using Jupyter Notebook that makes use of a support vector machine to predict the outcome of the next four Australia women's national football team matches, given results from the past five years (2020 through 2024).
### Prediction accuracy and mean absolute error
The model currently has an accuracy of <b>61.53%</b> (rounded to 2dp) and mean absolute error of <b>0.422</b> (rounded to 3sf).
### Success rate of predictions
The model currently has a success rate of <b>100%</b> from three fixtures predicted <i>(28th Nov v Brazil, 1st Dec v Brazil, 4th Dec v Chinese Taipei)</i>.
## Project roadmap (future additions)
+ Expand the dataset to cover results over a longer period of time. Currently the plan is to expand the win-loss records for both home and away fixtures gradually, in periods of five years at a time.
+ Implement a tracker that compares outcomes predicted by the model, and actual Matildas match results in order to measure the overall accuracy of the model.
## Data sources
+ Datasets for win-loss records based on [<i>Women's International Football Results</i>](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/martj42/womens-international-football-results) Kaggle dataset
+ [Matildas fixture information](https://matildas.com.au/fixtures)
